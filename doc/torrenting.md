## What Is Torrenting?

Before we can talk about the issues associated with torrenting, we need to understand a little better [how it works](https://www.howtogeek.com/141257/htg-explains-how-does-bittorrent-work/). Normally, when you download a file you send a request to a server and that server, usually operated by the company that runs the site you're downloading from, sends you that file.

Torrenting is different in that it's a decentralized system. Instead of sending a request to a server when you click a download button, you're instead downloading a small file called a tracker and opening it with a dedicated [BitTorrent client](https://github.com/arsscriptum/torrents-tracker).

The tracker connects you to a group of other users (usually called a swarm), some of whom have the whole file, while others have just a little bit of it. As you download the file, you're simultaneously uploading what you already have, making you both a downloader as well as an uploader.

The people connected to the swarm that have the whole file are called seeders, while people that are still in the process of getting it are called leechers. The more seeders a swarm has, the faster the download will usually be, though having too many leechers can throw off the balance enough to slow down the process.

## Decentralized vs. Centralized

At its core, torrenting is a peer-to-peer (P2P) form of downloading files that doesn't rely on central servers but instead on each member of a swarm to supply a file. As such, it's a great way to distribute files on the cheap and it's used for all kinds of legal downloads, mainly for open-source software.

Its downside is that it's usually a little slower than a direct download---though a healthy swarm is still pretty fast---and that it takes up more bandwidth as you need to upload as well as download. There's also an unwritten rule that you need to seed for a while after getting the whole file, it's just good manners.

Why Use Torrents for Piracy?
Because of its decentralized nature, torrenting is ideal for distributing copyrighted material. If files are kept on a single server, then copyright watchdogs and law enforcement can very easily come after that server. However, if you distribute those same files across a network, it's much harder to take down any illegally hosted files.

Between 2003 and now, though, you could still access The Pirate Bay through any of its many proxies and download warez. This is because the site itself is just a repository for trackers, the files are kept on the computers of seeders and leechers throughout the world. To shut down even a single torrent, you'd need to shut down every single person seeding it, and most of the leechers, too.


### **Technical Overview of Torrents and Tracker Protocols**

#### **1. Introduction to Torrents**
Torrents operate using the **BitTorrent protocol**, a peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing mechanism designed to distribute large files efficiently without requiring a centralized server. Instead of downloading a file from a single source, torrents break the file into smaller pieces and distribute them among multiple peers. This decentralized approach optimizes bandwidth usage, enhances redundancy, and ensures faster downloads.

#### **2. How Torrents Work**
1. **Torrent File / Magnet Link**: A torrent file contains metadata about the content being shared, including:
   - The list of file names and sizes.
   - Hash values for integrity verification.
   - A list of trackers that assist in peer discovery.
   
   Alternatively, a **magnet link** achieves the same result without requiring a separate `.torrent` file. It contains the hash of the file, which allows peers to find each other without a central server.

2. **Seeders & Leechers**:
   - **Seeders**: Users who have a complete copy of the file and are sharing it.
   - **Leechers**: Users who are downloading the file and may be uploading parts simultaneously.
   - **Peers**: A general term for both seeders and leechers.
   - **Swarm**: The entire network of peers sharing a specific torrent.

3. **Piece Exchange**:
   - The file is split into **small chunks (pieces)**, typically 256 KB to 4 MB in size.
   - Once a peer downloads a piece, it can immediately upload (seed) it to others, improving overall efficiency.

4. **Peer Discovery**:
   - Peers need a way to discover each other. This can be done via **trackers**, **DHT (Distributed Hash Table)**, **PEX (Peer Exchange)**, or **WebRTC for browser-based torrents**.

### **3. The Role of Trackers in the Download Process**
Trackers are servers that help peers discover each other by maintaining a list of active peers for a specific torrent. The tracker's role is crucial in the early stages of a download before DHT and PEX can fully take over.

#### **3.1 How Trackers Affect Speed**
- **More Trackers = More Peers**: Using multiple trackers increases the number of potential peers, improving download speeds.
- **High-Quality Trackers = Better Stability**: Some trackers are more reliable and responsive, leading to better connectivity.
- **Overloaded Trackers = Slower Discovery**: If a tracker has too many requests, peer discovery may be delayed.
- **Private Trackers = Controlled Environment**: Some trackers require authentication (private trackers), ensuring better seeding ratios but limiting access.

### **4. Tracker Protocols Explained**
Different tracker protocols are used to communicate between the torrent client and the tracker:

#### **4.1 UDP Trackers**
Example: `udp://tracker.opentrackr.org:1337/announce`
- **Faster and more lightweight** than HTTP-based trackers.
- Uses **connectionless** communication (no handshake required).
- Consumes less bandwidth and reduces tracker server load.
- Often blocked by firewalls because UDP is commonly associated with DDoS attacks.

#### **4.2 HTTP Trackers**
Example: `http://taciturn-shadow.spb.ru:6969/announce`
- Uses a standard **HTTP GET request** to communicate.
- Easier to implement and widely supported by all torrent clients.
- Higher overhead due to TCP connection establishment.
- More likely to be blocked by ISPs but works behind firewalls more easily than UDP.

#### **4.3 HTTPS Trackers**
Example: `https://tracker.yemekyedim.com/announce`
- Works the same as HTTP but with **TLS encryption**.
- Prevents ISPs from snooping on tracker traffic.
- More secure but slightly higher overhead due to encryption.

#### **4.4 WebSocket Trackers**
Example: `wss://tracker.webtorrent.dev/announce`
- Designed for **WebRTC-based torrents**, used in web-based torrent clients (e.g., WebTorrent).
- Uses a **WebSocket connection** instead of traditional HTTP or UDP.
- Enables torrenting **inside a browser** without requiring a desktop client.
- Limited to WebRTC-enabled peers, reducing overall availability.

### **5. Conclusion**
- Torrents function by **distributing small file pieces among peers** in a decentralized network.
- Trackers **help find peers**, improving download speed and connectivity.
- **Multiple tracker protocols (UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket)** provide different advantages in terms of speed, security, and compatibility.
- **Using a mix of trackers (both UDP and HTTP/HTTPS) is recommended** to ensure the best download performance and reliability.


### **Adding Trackers to a Torrent for Optimal Performance**

To maximize the number of peers and improve download speeds, you can manually add trackers to your torrent client. Here's how you can do it in different scenarios:

- **Why Add More Trackers?** Increases the number of available peers, reducing reliance on DHT.
- **What If Some Trackers Fail?** Clients will ignore dead trackers and use active ones.
- **Can Too Many Trackers Slow Things Down?** Not really, but too many failing trackers may slightly delay the peer discovery process.
